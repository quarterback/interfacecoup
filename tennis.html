        <h2>Tennis & Performance Leadership</h2>
        <p>Coaching competitive tennis with the same focus, resilience, and systems thinking I bring to complex organizational work.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="work">
        <div class="work-category section">
          <h3>Coaching Background</h3>
          <p>I'm the Head Girls' Tennis Coach at Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon. Since 2019, I've led the program to a state championship, produced multiple All-State players, and helped athletes move on to collegiate tennis at NCAA Division I and top academic institutions.</p>
          <p>Before Catlin, I coached at both the high school and collegiate levels across several states, developing state champions, regional winners, and first-time players into competitive athletes. I was named Oregon State Coach of the Year in 2022 and have earned district honors for coaching and program development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="work-category section">
          <h3>Leadership Roles</h3>
          <p>I serve as a State Tennis Co-Chair for the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association and sit on the OSAA State Seeding Committee. I also help lead efforts to modernize the team competition format for high school tennis in Oregon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="work-category section">
          <h3>Coaching Philosophy</h3>
          <p>My programs are built around resilience, independent decision-making, and preparation. I expect players to lead themselves first — developing the mindset to adapt, compete, and recover under pressure without relying on sideline instruction.</p>
          
          <blockquote class="coaching-quote">
            "I don't build programs around slogans. I build them around players who know what to do when things get hard."
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I bring experience from outside sports — including leadership roles in tech, public systems, and service — but the fundamentals are the same: Build trust. Do the work. Adapt under pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="work-category section">
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>I'm developing <a href="https://tennisrpo.netlify.app"><strong>Tennis RPO</strong></a> — a practical decision-making framework based on adapting the Read-Pass-Option concept from football to tennis. It's designed to give high school and small-college players a shared language for match strategy, mental toughness, and leadership development on court.</p>
