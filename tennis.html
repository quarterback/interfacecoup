          <h3>Coaching Background</h3>
          <p><strong>Ron Bronson enters his seventh year as head girls’ varsity tennis coach at Catlin Gabel School in Portland.</strong> Since taking over in 2020, he has kept the Eagles among Oregon’s elite, transforming their non-conference schedule to mirror 6A competition while competing in the 3A classification.</p>

          <p>In 2021, after the pandemic canceled the 2020 season, Catlin went 9-0 and swept 3A district titles: singles (Lola Diaz) and doubles (Anna Semler & Rachel Yoken). The Eagles were ranked <strong>No. 1 in 3A by Oregontennis.com</strong> with the OSAA state tournament canceled.</p>

          <p>In 2022, the Eagles posted a school-record 13-1 season and captured the program’s sixth OSAA state championship. Lola Diaz was state singles finalist and district singles champion, Anna Semler placed third at state, and Thea Kapteyn & Lily Wand won the district doubles crown. Seven players earned all-state recognition.</p>

          <p>The 2023 team went 15-3, finishing third at state. Amanda Perez & Lily Wand upset the defending champions to win the 4A/3A/2A/1A state doubles title, Catlin’s first since 1996 and only the second in program history.</p>

          <p>In 2024, after graduating 14 seniors, the Eagles rebuilt to finish 9-6-1 and sixth in the state. Amanda Perez reached the singles quarterfinals, while Jiya Mehta & Elise Kim won the district doubles title and the state consolation bracket.</p>

          <p>In 2025, Catlin finished 10-3-1 and placed fourth at state. Amanda Perez & Jiya Mehta completed a perfect 17-0 season en route to the state doubles championship, while Elise Kim & Ann Crosby advanced to the district semifinals and the state round of 16. All four earned all-state honors.</p>

          <h3>Leadership Roles</h3>

Since 2023, he has served as one of the OACA’s State Tennis Co-Chairs representing 4A–1A coaches, and in 2025 he chaired the OSAA state tennis seeding committee.</p>

          <h3>Prior Coaching</h3>

The boys finished third in the region.</p>

          <p>In 2019, he was head boys’ varsity coach at Oregon City High School. He began his career in Colorado as an assistant at Colorado Academy (2008–09) and later as head girls’ coach at Denver North (2010).</p>
