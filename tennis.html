    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Who I Am & What I Do</h2>
      <p>I'm a leadership and systems strategist with experience managing high-stakes digital transformations, public sector innovation, and teams across complex environments—including roles at global tech companies and government agencies. Before that, I served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, an experience that shaped my leadership style in clarity, precision, and trust-building.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">In parallel, I've spent over a decade as a competitive tennis coach at both developing and elite high school programs, including Catlin Gabel—one of Oregon's most decorated tennis programs. I've coached state champions, All-State players, and helped numerous athletes compete at the collegiate level, including Division I and top academic institutions nationwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Coaching Philosophy & Team Culture</h2>
      
      <p>My coaching is about more than tennis. It's about fostering confidence, independence, and composure. I build systems and use analytics to help players understand their performance, track improvement, and make smarter decisions under pressure. I transform tennis—an individual sport—into a true team environment.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        "I'd much rather you figure out how to work out of a jam than always look back relying on me to bail you out. I can only do so much with body language, when I can't take the racquet from you and win a few points on your behalf."
      </div>
      
      <p>This confidence-building approach has yielded classes of players who learn to trust themselves on court and, more importantly, in life. For female athletes especially, I emphasize decision-making independence and self-reliance – skills that translate directly to leadership roles throughout their lives.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Core Leadership Principles</h3>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Purpose-Driven Motivation:</strong> Creating benchmarks and giving players "something to play for" – essential for both athletic and professional growth</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Competition:</strong> Fostering healthy competition while prioritizing enjoyment of the process</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Development:</strong> Building a foundation of mutual trust through consistent support and progressive challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics-Informed Strategy:</strong> Implementing data-driven approaches that reveal hidden patterns and opportunities</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Leadership:</strong> Evolving strategies based on unique player needs while maintaining core values</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="quote mt-6">
        "Whether you're the #1 player or just starting out, my goal is the same: Equip you with the mindset and skills to exceed your own expectations."
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Competitive Analytics & Insights</h2>
      
      <p>I develop custom metrics that help players and coaches find incremental advantages, improve decision-making, and achieve sustainable success. As a self-described "analytics dork," I've pioneered systems that quantify the less tangible aspects of performance:</p>
      
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6">
        <div class="stat-card">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Work Rate</h3>
          <p>Quantifying effort and strategic effectiveness through measurable actions, scaled from 0-10. Highlights both physical exertion and court positioning.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stat-card">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">CLUTCH</h3>
          <p>Measuring performance in pivotal moments compared to baseline expectations. Identifies how individuals perform under pressure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stat-card">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">NET Score</h3>
          <p>Assessing conversion of effort into outcomes—true performance efficiency. Evaluates how effectively effort translates to results.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="mt-6">These frameworks provide targeted insights for both individual development and team strategy. While developed for tennis, these metrics translate seamlessly to measuring leadership effectiveness, team dynamics, and organizational performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Coaching Experience</h2>
      
      <p>As Head Coach at Catlin Gabel School since 2019, I've led one of Oregon's most decorated tennis programs. My teams have produced numerous All-State selections and collegiate tennis players, including at the NCAA Division I level.</p>
      
      <p>Prior to Catlin Gabel, I coached both scholastic and collegiate programs in three states and Colorado, developing championship teams and individual state, regional & district champions.</p>
      
      <p>My coaching has been recognized with Oregon State Coach of the Year honors, and I currently serve on the OSAA State Seeding Committee and as State Tennis Co-Chair for the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association (OACA), contributing to policy and strategic leadership of high school tennis statewide.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Leadership Approach</h2>
      
      <p>My coaching style fosters player agency within a structured environment. This approach mirrors effective organizational leadership, where empowering team members while providing clear direction creates sustainable success.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        "I run a program that I'd want to participate in. It doesn't mean it's always easy. You don't get what you want all the time. You can earn trust, role changes, and opportunities to try new things."
      </div>
      
      <p>The flexibility and adaptability required in tennis coaching directly translates to navigating complex organizational environments. Players in my program learn to:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Take ownership of their development process</li>
        <li>Contribute to team strategy and planning</li>
        <li>Adapt to changing conditions and opponents</li>
        <li>Balance individual goals with team objectives</li>
        <li>Develop resilience through progressive challenges</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mt-4">These skills form the foundation of effective leadership in any context, from sports to corporate environments to public institutions.</p>
