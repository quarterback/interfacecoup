 <h2>Tennis & Performance Leadership</h2>
        <p>High school tennis coach focused on developing resilient, self-reliant players through constraint-led coaching and systems thinking.</p>

        <h3>Coaching Philosophy</h3>
          <p>I believe in a <strong>constraint-led approach</strong> that empowers players to become problem-solvers on the court. Early in my high school coaching career, it was apparent to me that players were often looking back for answers in key moments. While this makes sense sometimes, I wanted to instill in them, the confidence to problem solve in real-time, understand that not every situation will be ideal, nor technique perfect, but what's more important is deciding how to get out of a jam and then we can always regroup later and work to ensure we don't have to (in the words of Brad Gilbert) "play ugly" every single time out on the court. </p>
          
          <p>My coaching centers on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trust & Autonomy:</strong> Players learn to trust their instincts and make decisions independently</li>
            <li><strong>Game-Based Learning:</strong> Practices built around tactical problems, not just technical repetition</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience Development:</strong> Preparing athletes for the mental challenges of competition</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics-Informed Insight:</strong> Using data to identify patterns and opportunities for growth</li>
          </ul>

     <p>Because I'm not a full-time tennis coach, I'm more interested in using sports as a tool for lifelong lessons, versus only focusing on winning and losing. I've coached state champions and developing programs and I've played on teams of all sorts in my scholastic and collegiate career as well. I played college tennis at Monmouth College and four years of varsity high school tennis at Plainfield (NJ) High School under the tutelage of <a href="https://oralhistory.rutgers.edu/explore/alphabetical-index/interviewees/1507-van-blake-donald" target="_blank">Donald Van Blake</a>. </p>

  <h3>Coaching Achievements</h3>
  <p>I've spent the past three years as a state tennis co-chair for the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association. I'm in my 11th season of high school coaching across three states.</p>

  <p>My current program has won Oregon Team State Championships (2022 OSAA 4A/3A/2A/1A and 2021 Oregon 3A), along with three District/Regional Team Titles and four Conference Titles. I've coached two Oregon Girls Doubles State Champion teams (2025 and 2023) and a State Singles Finalist (2022), as well as state individual champions & finalists prior to my time in Oregon.</p>

  <p>I've coached a total of 14 All-State selections, a State Player of the Year Finalist, and multiple players advancing to collegiate tennis—including one at the NCAA Division I level. In 2023, I was named 4A/3A/2A/1A OACA Girls Tennis Coach of the Year award. and honored by my peers in 2022 as 4A District 1 Coach of the Year.</p>

  <p>Beyond high school, I've served as a college assistant coach and spent several seasons as a tennis director at camps throughout New England, rounding out a coaching career dedicated to developing athletes at every level.</p>
