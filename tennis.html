        <h1>Tennis & Performance Leadership</h1>
        <p>Coaching competitive tennis with the same focus, resilience, and systems thinking I bring to complex organizational work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Coaching Background</h2>
        <p>I'm the Head Girls' Tennis Coach at Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon. Since 2019, I've led the program to a state championship, produced multiple All-State players, and helped athletes move on to collegiate tennis at NCAA Division I and top academic institutions.</p>
        <p>Before Catlin, I coached at both the high school and collegiate levels across several states, developing state champions, regional winners, and first-time players into competitive athletes. I was named Oregon State Coach of the Year in 2022 and have earned district honors for coaching and program development.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Leadership Roles</h2>
        <p>I serve as a State Tennis Co-Chair for the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association and sit on the OSAA State Seeding Committee. I also help lead efforts to modernize the team competition format for high school tennis in Oregon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My programs are built around resilience, independent decision-making, and preparation. I expect players to lead themselves first — developing the mindset to adapt, compete, and recover under pressure without relying on sideline instruction.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          "I don't build programs around slogans. I build them around players who know what to do when things get hard."
        </div>
        <p>I bring experience from outside sports — including leadership roles in tech, public systems, and service — but the fundamentals are the same: Build trust. Do the work. Adapt under pressure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I'm developing <a href="https://tennisrpo.netlify.app"><strong>Tennis RPO</a></strong> — a practical decision-making framework based on adapting the Read-Pass-Option concept from football to tennis. It's designed to give high school and small-college players a shared language for match strategy, mental toughness, and leadership development on court.</p>
