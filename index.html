          I'm a strategist, designer, and critical theorist focused on complexity, institutional resilience, and service delivery at scale. My work lives at the intersection of systems strategy, AI governance, and interface design for public and civic institutions.

        <p>
          At a time when public trust is fragile and institutions face cascading crises, I help organizations—governments, nonprofits, and mission-driven companies—rethink how services are designed and delivered. My practice blends strategic foresight, service design, and domain diagnostics to surface risks, clarify opportunities, and build adaptive capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a city government, an advocacy org, or a forward-looking consultancy, I work with teams navigating complexity, degradation, and digital transformation to build strategy grounded in real-world constraints and the long arc of public life.

          This site houses both my consulting practice and my open research projects, including the <a href="/research.html">Interface Memetics Lab</a>—a space for examining how platformization and system capture reshape the fabric of governance and daily life.
