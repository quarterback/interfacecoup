        I'm Ron Bronson, a critical theorist and design strategist focused on the societal implications of technology systems. I've previously worked at <a href="https://18f.org" target="_blank">18F</a>, the federal government's digital services agency, where I led large-scale digital transformation initiatives across multiple federal agencies, as Director & Head of Design for four years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2017, I've been developing the concept of <strong>Consequence Design</strong> — a framework for examining how interfaces, services, and systems create cascading effects on social structures and individual lives. My work sits at the intersection of critical theory, service design, and <em>"discursive design"</em> — design that challenges assumptions, provokes debate, and exposes underlying power structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm focused on how algorithmic systems and Large Language Models fundamentally reshape human interaction and daily life. This includes exploring the emerging field of Agent Experience, investigating how AI-mediated interactions will be designed, governed, and contextualized in ways that respect human agency and dignity.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Speaking & Writing</h2>
      <p>
        I speak internationally on consequence design, critical systems, and the future of human-AI interaction. Recent talks include keynotes at IxDA Oslo, ConveyUX, UX Australia, and the Rosenfeld Media Civic Design Conference. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My writing on critical design and technological consequences appears in various publications. I'm currently developing a book exploring how interface design shapes socio-political realities and how we might design more just systems.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Teaching & Academic Work</h2>
      <p>
        In Spring 2024, I served on the faculty at the University of Michigan's Taubman School of Architecture and Urban Planning, where I taught Service Design & Urban Needs. My course explored how service design methodologies can address complex urban challenges while centering equity and lived experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research and teaching approach draws from critical theory, science and technology studies, and public interest design, with particular attention to how technological systems amplify or mitigate structural inequality.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Beyond Design</h2>
      <p>
        Though my design work often takes center stage, I lead a life rich with diverse interests. I'm a multi-state championship high school tennis coach who was named Oregon 4A Girls State Tennis Coach of the Year in 2022. I'm also an inexplicable <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pesapallofan?lang=fi" target="_blank">Pesäpallo enthusiast</a> (Finnish baseball), a sport whose strategic complexity offers surprising parallels to my work in systems thinking.
