      <p>
        Since 2017, I've been developing the concept of <strong>Consequence Design</strong> — a framework for examining how interfaces, services, and systems create cascading effects on social structures and individual lives. My work sits at the intersection of critical theory, service design, and what Bruce and Stephanie Tharp define as "discursive design" — design that challenges assumptions, provokes debate, and exposes underlying power structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm focused on how algorithmic systems and Large Language Models fundamentally reshape human interaction and daily life. I'm particularly engaged with the emerging field of <a href="https://agentexperience.ax" target="_blank">Agent Experience (AX)</a>, where I'm asking critical questions about how AI-mediated experiences will be designed, governed, and contextualized.

      <p>
        In Spring 2024, I served on the faculty at the University of Michigan's Taubman School of Architecture and Urban Planning, where I taught Service Design & Urban Needs. My course explored how service design methodologies can address complex urban challenges while centering equity and lived experience.

      <p>
        My research and teaching approach draws from critical theory, science and technology studies, and public interest design, with particular attention to how technological systems amplify or mitigate structural inequality.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Beyond Design</h2>
      <p>
        Though my design work often takes center stage, I lead a life rich with diverse interests. I'm a multi-state championship high school tennis coach who was named Oregon 4A Girls State Tennis Coach of the Year in 2022. I'm also an inexplicable <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pesapallofan?lang=fi" target="_blank">Pesäpallo enthusiast</a> (Finnish baseball), a sport whose strategic complexity offers surprising parallels to my work in systems thinking.

      <p>
        I speak internationally on consequence design, critical systems, and the future of human-AI interaction. Recent talks include keynotes at IxDA Oslo, ConveyUX, UX Australia, and the Rosenfeld Media Civic Design Conference. For speaking inquiries, <a href="mailto:ron@ronbronson.design">email me</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My writing on critical design and technological consequences appears in various publications. I'm currently developing a book exploring how interface design shapes socio-political realities and how we might design more just systems.
