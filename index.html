    I architect how systems behave—especially the ones that shape public life.
  </h1>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
    I'm Ron Bronson, an interaction architect and service designer working at the edge of public infrastructure, institutional design, and emerging technology. My work spans national governments, city systems, and digital platforms—focusing on how we deliver services that actually serve people.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
    From advising federal agencies on modernization strategy to speaking internationally on interface governance and consequence design, I help organizations align systems with outcomes—and deliver at the speed of need. My practice blends critical foresight, agile delivery, and structural clarity to move ideas from paper to production without losing the humans in the loop.

  <p>
    I work at the intersection of technology, institutions, and critical theory. My background spans public interest tech, civic design, policy delivery, and systems strategy. I’ve led multi-agency transformations, taught graduate students how to map service ecosystems, and built scrappy field projects with volunteers on shoestrings.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days, I think a lot about how software and AI systems are reshaping public life—often without much scrutiny. I’m interested in how we protect social context, institutional memory, and human dignity while still building things that work. Not everything needs to scale. Sometimes it just needs to be <em>right</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether I’m advising an org on platform risk, coaching a design team, or helping policymakers unpack a vendor contract, I’m always asking: <strong>what are the second-order effects of this system, and who gets left behind?</strong>

<section class="section">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Stuff I Think About</h2>
  <p>
    I write and speak on <strong>consequence design</strong>, <strong>interface policy</strong>, and <strong>context intelligence</strong>—how platforms shape society, and how we build systems that don’t leave people behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might’ve seen me at IxDA Oslo, UX Australia, ConveyUX, or Rosenfeld Media’s Civic Design Conference. Or read my work in publications like A List Apart and Public Sector Network. I'm currently working on a book about how interfaces became our institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're building AI tools, rethinking public infrastructure, or just trying to make things work better for more people—I probably have some thoughts. <a href="https://blog.ronbronson.com" class="underline">Check the blog →</a>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Also Me</h2>
  <p>
    Outside work, I coach high school tennis (Oregon 4A Girls State Coach of the Year, 2022), co-host the <a href="https://futureperfectbook.club/" target="_blank">Future Perfect Book Club</a> podcast, and sometimes DJ or anchor local radio news. In 2004, I invented Tennis Polo (Toccer)—a weird sport that somehow still exists.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have a longstanding obsession with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pesapallofan" target="_blank">Pesäpallo</a>, Finnish baseball. It’s complicated.
