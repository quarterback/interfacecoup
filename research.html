  <h1>Research</h1>
  
  <section>
    <p>
      I am a designer, scholar & strategist with deep roots in technology. My research focuses on the design, implementation, and downstream effects of digital systems in civic life.
    </p>
    
  <p>
      My current research focuses on the design, deployment, and downstream effects of digital systems in civic life. I study service delivery infrastructure, the operational realities of digital transformation at institutional scale, and the systemic impacts of platform technologies on public systems. Drawing from service design, urban technology, and critical infrastructure studies, my work interrogates how digital tools reconfigure governance, access, and everyday urban experience. This research informs the development of <span class="emphasis">consequence design</span> as a framework for understanding and mitigating the long-term impacts of complex system deployment.

    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
    <p>
      My current work explores:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How digital transformations reshape service delivery in public and private contexts</li>
      <li>The mechanics of interface-level persistence and resilience in complex service environments</li>
      <li>Administrative friction patterns and their role in system performance</li>
      <li>Design methods for maintaining operational clarity at scale, especially during rapid technological adoption</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      My research is informed by extensive experience scaling digital service teams and leading significant transformation initiatives. At 18F, I led multimillion-dollar digital service engagements across federal agencies, bridging strategic vision with tactical implementation. Previously, I built and managed cross-functional deployment teams across sector, developing a practical understanding of how digital systems function—and fail—in complex organizational environments.
