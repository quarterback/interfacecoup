      <h1>Research & Writing</h1>
      <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.7;">
        My research explores the intersection of infrastructure, interface, and institutional life. I work at the edge of speculative design, public systems, and critical theory to examine how seemingly small design decisions have far-reaching consequences.

        <p>
          Through the lens of <strong>consequence design</strong>, I examine how technical systems—especially those mediated through AI, interfaces, and automation—reshape civic life, governance, and public trust. My work maps how platforms encode fragility and how institutions become dependent on tools that were never designed for the public interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approach these questions not from a purely academic perspective, but as a practitioner with a background in public service, civic technology, and digital strategy. My frameworks draw from lived systems work, critical design, and theoretical traditions, focusing on what systems owe the people they govern—and how power circulates through both code and control.

      <h2>Upcoming Research</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in developing new frameworks around <strong>interface traps</strong> and the political work of spectacle—how narratives about technology become governance tools themselves. These inquiries are part of an ongoing body of work that merges policy thinking with speculative research.
