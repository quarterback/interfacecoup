# Interface Coup: A Speculative Design Project

This project explores how control over technical interfaces enables systemic transformation without formal power changes. Through interactive visualizations, system maps, and critical analysis, we examine patterns of interface control, crisis cascades, and infrastructure parasitism in modern systems.

## Core Concepts

### Interface Coup
The seizure of power through control of administrative interfaces rather than physical force. This happens when:
- Direct relationships are replaced by platform-mediated ones
- Organizations lose ability to operate independently
- Technical interfaces become de facto control points
- Resistance becomes procedurally impossible

### Crisis Cascades
How system failures compound and accelerate, particularly when:
- Administrative systems are compromised
- Infrastructure dependencies create cascading failures
- Knowledge networks are disrupted
- Community resilience is undermined

### Infrastructure Parasitism
The process by which platforms and interfaces:
- Degrade existing capabilities while creating dependencies
- Convert institutional knowledge into private control
- Transform public resources into extraction points
- Create artificial barriers to independent operation

## Project Components

### System Maps
Interactive visualizations showing relationships between:
- Interface control points
- Actor networks
- Resource flows
- Power relationships
- Dependency chains

### Critical Analysis
Written exploration of:
- System transformation patterns
- Control mechanisms
- Resistance strategies
- Alternative architectures
- Future implications

### Speculative Scenarios
Future-oriented examinations of:
- System evolution
- Control patterns
- Resistance possibilities
- Alternative structures
- Transformative pathways
